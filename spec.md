Predicting Boston Housing Prices
================================

### Model Evaluation & Validation Project

Project Description
-------------------

You want to be the best real estate agent out there. In order to compete
with other agents in your area, you decide to use machine learning. You
are going to use various statistical analysis tools to build the best
model to predict the value of a given house. Your task is to find the
best price your client can sell their house at. The best guess from a
model is one that best generalizes the data.

For this assignment your client has a house with the following feature
set: \[11.95, 0.00, 18.100, 0, 0.6590, 5.6090, 90.00, 1.385, 24, 680.0,
20.20, 332.09, 12.13\]. To get started, use the example scikit
implementation. You will have to modify the code slightly to get the
file up and running.

When you are done implementing the code please answer the following
questions in a report with the appropriate sections provided.

Language and libraries
----------------------

For this project, you will need to have the following software
installed:

-   [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
-   [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
-   [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

Template code
-------------

Download
[boston\_housing.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/nd009/projects/boston_housing.zip),
unzip it and open the `boston_housing.py` template file. Follow the
instructions to complete each step, and answer the questions in your
report.

Deliverables
------------

-   Report in PDF format
-   Fully implemented Boston Housing Python code as `boston_housing.py`

You can package these two files as a single zip and submit it.

Questions and Report Structure
------------------------------

### 1) Statistical Analysis and Data Exploration

-   Number of data points?
-   Number of features?
-   Minimum and maximum housing prices?
-   Mean and median Boston housing prices?
-   Standard deviation?

### 2) Evaluating Model Performance

-   Which measure of model performance is best to use for regression and
    predicting Boston housing data? Why is this measurement most
    appropriate? Why might the other measurements not be appropriate
    here?
-   Why is it important to split the data into training and testing
    data? What happens if you do not do this?
-   Which cross validation technique do you think is most appropriate
    and why?
-   What does grid search do and why might you want to use it?

### 3) Analyzing Model Performance

-   Look at all learning curve graphs provided. What is the general
    trend of training and testing error as training size increases?
-   Look at the learning curves for the decision tree regressor with max
    depth 1 and 10 (first and last learning curve graphs). When the
    model is fully trained does it suffer from either high
    bias/underfitting or high variance/overfitting?
-   Look at the model complexity graph. How do the training and test
    error relate to increasing model complexity? Based on this
    relationship, which model (max depth) best generalizes the dataset
    and why?

### 4) Model Prediction

-   Model makes predicted housing price with detailed model parameters
-   Compare prediction to earlier statistics

### Evaluation

Your project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against **[this
rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oT53-kMhiarkHvAbL0e-dXA_gsXTxjPn_fuO_5yyDYk/pub)**.
Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must
"meet specifications" in order to pass.

### Submission

When you're ready to submit your project go back to your [Udacity
Home](https://www.udacity.com/me), click on Project 1, and we'll walk
you through the rest of the submission process.

If you are having any problems submitting your project or wish to check
on the status of your submission, please email us at
**project@udacity.com** or visit us in the [discussion
forums](http://discussions.udacity.com).

### What's Next?

You will get an email as soon as your reviewer has feedback for you. In
the meantime, review your next project and feel free to get started on
it or the courses supporting it!
